This script will look in the script folder for images(png).
The scritpt will then present the image to the user and ask for the name of the image.
If one enter the correct name, a random other image will be shown. 
The names are not shown. The file names ending with B will be 
added to the side of the file without a B. The B file can be used to 
hint the user about what the name is.

Requires wxWidgets.
